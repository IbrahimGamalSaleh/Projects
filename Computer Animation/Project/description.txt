                                                === Project Description ===
                                                ===========================
												

Generally, the game is of 'Platform' genre, specifically 'Endless Runner' type. Temple Run and Subway Surfers are of this type.

The game starts with Start Menu with three options, play a new game, purchase power-ups, and exit.
	- 'play a new game' option: starts a new game.
	- 'purchase power-ups' option: a view with upgrades to buy, and a 'back' button.
		- upgrades include power-up lifetime increasing, will be explained in a while.
		- power-up pocket-size increasing, will be explained in a while.
	- 'exit' option: either exits game, or stops the 'playmode' in unity.


'Start Menu' scene is the same as 'New Game' scene, except for it's standing still in start menu, while it starts running when a new game starts.

New Game:
	The character starts running the road ahead, while it has three states. First, default state, is to continue running. Second, to move either right of left or to jump or to  to evade a block in its way. Lastly, it crashed into a block and so it died.
	
	The character, has a 'pocket' which allows it to store power-ups it finds in its way, while it's not the case for Trick power-ups[*1] which is applicable immediately. Power-ups are applicable immediately if the pocket is full, as well.
	
	Pocket slots are number from 1 through n, say it has 3 slots so it's 1-2-3. Power-ups are applicated when it's number is got as input from keyboard.
	
	On death, there will be a choice to continue after paying a sum of coins increasing exponentially with number of times, limited to 7 revives. Then, number of choices same as currently acquired power-ups for player to retrieve his power-ups from previous life. Power-ups prices are same, relative with revival price.

	Running Speed is slowing down by the time and reaching a milestone reset speed to normal. Not effective when 'speed up' or 'slow down' power-up is in effect.
	
	While playing, player is in either normal, weak or super state. Default and start state is normal.
	States are sorted from weak to strong as following; weak, normal, and super.
	Blocks may vary between glass, wood or metal.
		- Glass blocks could be crashed into without problem had the character in normal state, while in weak state the player must evade it.
		- Wood blocks could be crashed into without problem had the character in 'super' state, while in normal state the player must evade it.
		- Metal blocks couldn't be crashed into in any state and must be avoided.
		
Power-ups:
	 - speed up, jump higher, gun, super
	*- slow down, no jump, weak as paper, death
