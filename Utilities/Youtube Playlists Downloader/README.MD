A pyhton script utilizing Youtube-dl and Aria2c libraries, to download a youtube playlist.

Youtube-dl is, already, implementing the option to download a playlist, however it all comes down to some paramters and commands.

This python script creates some batch '.bat' files, one for each video in the playlist, and every group of 10 files are handeled by a file.

That was the manual way, or semi-manual, to download a playlist. An automatic way is to run some python script generated by the main script.

That pyhton script, using multi-threading, maintains downloading the files.

A number of threads, say 5, are created and take turns to check if there are files in a queue, which is used to hold all remaining
 downloads, takes it out, runs its batch file, and waits for it to finish downloading.

In case of any mishap causes a batch file in a thread to close or cancel, it is checked after each finished download if the file numbered 
 with this batch file number is successfully downloaded, and if not this batch is inserted again in queue while maintaining its priority
 at top as it has smaller index in playlist than other downloads that has not been reached yet.
